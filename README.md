# Brewin
Brewin, a fusion of C++ and Python, incorporates a robust set of functionalities that harness the strengths of both languages.

Functionality: 
- Support for one or more function definitions in addition to main()
- Functions may have zero or more parameters
- Functions may return a result
- Support for boolean variables in addition to integer and string variables
- Support for a new value called "nil" which is like None in Python or nullptr in C++
- Support for all binary integer arithmetic operations, including: +, -, *, / as well as unary negation
- Support for integer comparison operations, including: ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=
- Support for boolean comparison operations, including: ==, !=
- Support for boolean AND, OR and NOT operations: &&, ||, !
- Support for string comparison operations, including: ==, !=
- Support for string concatenation, e.g.: c = a + b;
- Support for if, if/else statements, and while loops  
- Support for a new built-in function called inputs() to input strings from the user
- Brewin is a dynamically scoped language

What's New in Brewin++?

- Brewin++ now supports first-class functions (e.g., passing functions as arguments, returning functions, storing functions in variables)
- Brewin++ now supports lambdas/closures
- Brewin++ now supports pass-by-reference parameter passing in addition to pass-by-value
- Brewin++ now supports limited type coercions
